# Trees-and-Forest (in R)

## Example of Decision trees and Random Forest application 
Welcome! This repo hosts 3 studies regarding the use of Decision Regression tree applications on the car insurance dataset. The goal is to estimate the "pure premium" of an insurance contract, by modelling claims frequency and severity separately. To do this, we will compare:
-  a Single Tree,
- the benefit of Bagging,
- and a Random Forest.
We will explain the pros and cons of each method, tackling the hyper-parameter tuning strategy involved. This was a good project to explore the different functionality of the packages available in R.
