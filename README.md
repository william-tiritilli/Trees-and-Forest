Welcome! This repo hosts 3 study regarding the use of Decision Regression tree applications on an Insurance dataset.

- Bagging,
- Random Forest,
We will explain the pros and cons of each method while exploring the different packages available in R. help us to estimate the claims frequency and its cost (Severity) to define the "pure premium" of an insurance contract calculation.
